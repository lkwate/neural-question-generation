# Reinforcement Learning Generator-Evaluator Architecture for Question Generation. 
[demo colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AQP9ELGoTOuZw6XPGitzw6_uKUAnO8Z5?usp=sharing)
  
The is based on Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer framework **T5** provided Google AI, that consists of stacks of Transformer-Encoder layers (linked in BERT fashion) and Transformer-Decoder layers (also lined in BERT fashion). The training of the Generator T5 was drived by an Evaluator that optimized the Generator parameters on task-specific reward function (BLEU + GenSim) through Policy Gradient.


## Introduction 
In our educational system, the common form of examination is question forms, the teachers are generally charged to design question forms, for the students. To reach the general education purpose that aims to improve the cognitive skills of the students about a specific knowledge, it is important to design the relevant questions to evaluate the skills of the students in this specific context. We designed a system that tries to produce conditional question based on a given corpus. the system designed is unilingual (English). the system will be benefit for educators by saving their time for generating examination.

However, the other sites were not as deadly, although working conditions were generally very harsh</th>
